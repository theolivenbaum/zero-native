## 0.1.8

### Bug Fixes

- **Install completion delay** - Drain redirected GitHub responses during postinstall so npm exits immediately after the native binary is installed.

## 0.1.7

## 0.1.6

## 0.1.5

### Bug Fixes

- **macOS local asset loading** - Prefer current-directory asset roots during local `zig build run` so Vite-based examples render their production bundles instead of blank windows.

## 0.1.4

### Bug Fixes

- **Scaffolded app builds** - Ship the framework source tree in the npm package and make `zero-native init` point generated apps at the installed package root so `zig build run` can resolve `src/root.zig`.
- **Long scaffold names** - Keep generated Zig package names within Zig's 32-character manifest limit.
- **Next scaffold builds** - Include the Node.js type package that Next expects for TypeScript projects.
- **Frontend dependency versions** - Generate projects with current Next, React, Vite, Vue, Svelte, and plugin versions.
- **Svelte scaffold builds** - Use the matching Svelte Vite plugin in generated Svelte projects.

## 0.1.3

### Bug Fixes

- **CLI package homepage** - Point npm package metadata at `https://zero-native.dev`.
- **Current-directory init** - Support `zero-native init --frontend <framework>` as shorthand for scaffolding into the current directory.
- **CLI usage errors** - Exit cleanly for invalid CLI arguments instead of printing Zig stack traces for expected user input mistakes.

## 0.1.2

### Bug Fixes

- **npm install fallback** - Do not fail package installation or point global shims at missing binaries when a native release asset is unavailable.
- **Release asset ordering** - Upload the macOS arm64 native binary and `CHECKSUMS.txt` before publishing the npm package so postinstall downloads succeed immediately.

## 0.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- **npm package homepage** - Add the zero-native repository homepage to the CLI package metadata.
- **Chromium example launches** - Stage the CEF framework correctly for the `hello` and `webview` examples when running with `-Dweb-engine=chromium`.
- **Linux WebKitGTK build** - Update navigation policy and external URI handling for current WebKitGTK and GTK4 headers.
- **macOS WebView smoke test** - Use the emitted CLI binary and queue automation early enough for stable CI smoke tests.

### Release Process

- **GitHub releases** - Create missing GitHub releases from marked changelog entries when npm already has the version.
- **CEF runtime release** - Publish the prepared macOS arm64 CEF runtime used by `zero-native cef install`.
